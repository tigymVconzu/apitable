If you own an Epson printer model L130, L220, L310, L360 or L365, you may have encountered a problem where the printer stops working and displays an error message like "Service required" or "Ink pad is at the end of its service life". This is because the printer has a built-in counter that tracks the number of pages printed and the amount of ink waste generated. When the counter reaches a certain limit, the printer locks itself and prevents further printing.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to hack the Epson adjustment program and reset the counter without having to take your printer to a service center or buy a new one. In this article, we will show you how to do it in a few simple steps.

Congratulations! You have successfully hacked the Epson adjustment program and reset your printer. You can now print as usual without any error messages or limitations. However, keep in mind that this is only a temporary solution and that you should replace or clean the waste ink pads periodically to avoid damage to your printer.
  
## Why Do You Need to Hack the Epson Adjustment Program?
 
The Epson adjustment program is a software tool that allows you to perform various maintenance tasks on your printer, such as cleaning the print head, aligning the print head, checking the nozzle pattern, and so on. However, it also has a hidden function that monitors the waste ink pads and locks the printer when they are full.
 
The waste ink pads are sponge-like components that absorb the excess ink that is ejected from the print head during cleaning cycles or when the printer is turned on or off. Over time, these pads get saturated with ink and need to be replaced or cleaned. However, Epson does not provide any easy way for users to do this. Instead, they force you to take your printer to an authorized service center or buy a new one when the waste ink pads are full.
 
This is a very unfair and wasteful practice that costs users a lot of money and harms the environment. That's why many people choose to hack the Epson adjustment program and reset the waste ink pad counter themselves. This way, they can extend the life of their printer and save money on unnecessary repairs or replacements.
 
## What Are the Risks of Hacking the Epson Adjustment Program?
 
While hacking the Epson adjustment program and resetting the waste ink pad counter can be very beneficial, it also comes with some risks that you should be aware of. Here are some of them:
 
- **Voiding your warranty:** Hacking the Epson adjustment program and resetting the waste ink pad counter may void your printer's warranty. If you encounter any problems with your printer after doing this, you may not be able to get any support or service from Epson.
- **Damaging your printer:** If you hack the Epson adjustment program and reset the waste ink pad counter without replacing or cleaning the waste ink pads, you may cause damage to your printer. The ink may overflow from the pads and leak into other parts of the printer, such as the circuit board, the print head, or the paper feed mechanism. This may result in malfunctioning, poor print quality, or even fire hazards.
- **Downloading malware:** When you download the Epson adjustment program from online sources, you may expose your computer to malware or viruses. Some websites may offer fake or modified versions of the program that contain malicious code that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Make sure you download the program from a reliable source and scan it for viruses before running it.

Therefore, before you hack the Epson adjustment program and reset your printer, make sure you weigh the pros and cons carefully and take precautions to avoid any problems.
