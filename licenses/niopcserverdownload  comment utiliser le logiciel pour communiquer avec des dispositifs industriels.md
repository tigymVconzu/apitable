## Using NI OPC Servers
 
To use NI OPC Servers, you need to install it on your computer and activate it with your serial number. You can then launch the NI OPC Servers Configuration Manager from the Start menu or from LabVIEW. The Configuration Manager allows you to create and manage OPC projects, which contain the settings and information for communicating with your devices.
 
You can use the Configuration Manager to add devices, configure communication parameters, browse device tags, test connections, and monitor data. You can also import and export OPC projects for backup or sharing purposes.
 
To access the data from your devices in LabVIEW, you need to use the LabVIEW DSC Module or the LabVIEW OPC UA Toolkit. The LabVIEW DSC Module provides VIs and functions for creating OPC clients that can read and write data to OPC servers. The LabVIEW OPC UA Toolkit is a software add-on for LabVIEW that contains the OPC UA API that integrates secure and reliable communications. You can use this toolkit to create OPC UA clients and servers, as well as security management.
